The Nazis had also lowered the voting age, in large part so as to ensure that the electorate was about the same size as in 1934 but also to exploit the relatively enthusiastic support of younger Germans for the Nazi regime. Thus, the result was 741 seats secured in the Reichstag with 98,8% of the votes and 98.8% voting in favour of the occupation of the Rhineland."
