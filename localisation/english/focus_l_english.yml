 FRA_replace_ft_desc:0 "The FT-17, although effective, is heavily outclassed and outdated, with its armour pierceable with the lightest of anti-tank weapons. Development of a new, swift but fairly armoured tank shall be put into place."
 FRA_armored_divisions:0 "Adapt Armoured Divisions"
 FRA_armored_divisions_desc:0 "Tank battalions can be effective, but stand no chance against an organised tank division. The Sino-Japanese and the Spanish Civil wars have shown us the true power of a concentrated armoured push."
 FRA_char_lourd:0 "Char Lourd"
 FRA_char_lourd_desc:0 "The Char 2C is still the largest tank ever built, but it is no longer invulnarable in the current battlefield. The long lasting project to replace it with a modern rolling fortress to push through the siegfried line has finally beared fruit in the shape of FCM F1."
 FRA_mass_production:0 "Accelerate Mass Production"

 FRA_see_to_daladier:0 "See to Daladier"
 FRA_see_to_daladier_desc:0 "Without support of the government the reactionary high command will not seek changes in the army, stating that the war has been won by us and that surely the same tactics we used merely 20 years ago will work yet again. Perhaps the Bull is willing to help."
 FRA_redirect_production:0 "Redirect Military Production"
 FRA_redirect_production_desc:0 "The Treaty of Versailles, no matter how inefficient it was, at least served its purpose in buying us enough time to curb Germany’s warship production. With the La-Manche secured, our British allies controlling the Mediterranean and the Royal Navy being superior to the Regia Marina in every regard, our naval facilities can be redirected to produce artillery for the army, not the navy."
 FRA_war_council:0 "Secretary General of the War Council"

 FRA_gamelin:0 "Gamelin Must Go"

 FRA_redefine_armor:0 "Redefine the Role of Armour"
 FRA_redefine_armor_desc:0 "The restrictions put on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles bought us enough time to outclass and outnumber the German fleet. The only threat is the Mediterranean, but the Regia Marina is outdated and outclassed by the Royal Navy. We need to put focus on the main front - the German-French border and we need armoured behemoths if we are to stand any chance."
 FRA_adapt_tempo:0 "Adapt to Faster Operational Tempo"

 FRA_pierre_cot:0 "The Return of Pierre Cot"
 FRA_pierre_cot_desc:0 "Firing Pierre Cot in 1934 as our aviation minister was a horrible idea. The new minister has shown himself to be a corrupt bureaucrat, not caring about the aviation industry at all. Pierre would be very happy to have his prestigious job back and we expect improvements in the airforce."
 FRA_armee_del:0 "Rearm the Armée l'Air"

 FRA_the_deal:0 "The Deal"
 FRA_the_deal_desc:0 "The successful performance of German Luftwaffe warplanes during the Spanish Civil War suddenly made us realise our military inferiority. Germany has better warplanes, more of them, pilots with wartime experience in Spain, and much more efficient factories. President Roosevelt had long been interested in France, and was a personal friend of French Senator, Baron Amaury de La Grange. He told Roosevelt about the French weaknesses, and asked for military help. Roosevelt was forthcoming, and forced the War Department to secretly sell the most modern American airplanes to France."
 FRA_match_reich:0 "Push to Match the Reich"
 FRA_match_reich_desc:0 "With the amount of investment put into the airforce it would be a shame to end it right now.

 FRA_reform_the_economic_council:0 "Continue the Policy of Deflation"
 FRA_reform_the_economic_council_desc:0 "The Great War and the Great Depression wasn’t exactly good for the economy and our currency in particular. The franc lost its value because of our dependency on American loans and our inability to pay those loans back. If we don’t stop printing money and start reducing the amount of currency on the market we can somewhat stabilise the price."

 FRA_the_war_at_our_border_desc:0 "The political and ideological turmoil in Spain finally boiled down… and caused a fire. The Spanish Republic, with its government in an alliance of circumstance with communists and socialists is in dire need of help. Blum, despite being pressured by the far-left part of the Front Populare, is unwilling to send arms to the rightful Spanish government, opting to stay neutral.
