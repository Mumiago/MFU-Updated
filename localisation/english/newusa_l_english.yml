Many employers refuse to meet demands for higher wages, safer conditions, and union recognition, leading to standoffs between management and workers.

In some towns, entire shifts have been eliminated, leaving hundreds without steady pay. Construction firms are postponing new projects, and rail freight traffic has declined noticeably.

Investment projects are being shelved, and banks are demanding early repayment of loans from struggling companies. Newspapers run grim headlines, comparing the downturn to the dark days of 1929.

Union halls report rising agitation, while right- and left-wing groups alike draw larger crowds. In some cities, minor strikes and scuffles have already broken out.

At the same time, Congress moves to finally dismantle the New Deal, using the national mood as fuel for budget cuts.

usa.430.d:0 "With unemployment climbing and industrial production faltering, President Roosevelt has decided to reverse earlier cutbacks to federal programs. Billions will be poured back into public works, relief efforts, and infrastructure projects across the nation. The Works Progress Administration and Public Works Administration are receiving renewed funding to restart construction sites that have stood idle for months. From highways to bridges, schools to dams, shovels are returning to the ground."

Thanks to this influx of funding, the recovery began almost immediately. Workers are back on road crews, building new schools, post offices, and courthouses. Across the country, federal payrolls have swelled again. Farmers are seeing more demand for produce to feed workers, and small-town shops are noticing the return of regular customers. While still far from full recovery, this wave of hiring has injected much-needed energy into local economies."

This recovery is driven not only by sustained government programs but also by growing foreign demand. With rising tensions in Europe, American steel mills and machinery manufacturers are seeing increased orders from abroad, providing a much-needed boost to key industries. Though challenges remain and the economy is still fragile, the Roosevelt Recession has finally given way to a hopeful upswing. Public confidence is returning, and many credit the administration’s renewed efforts for this turnaround."

usa.428.d:0 "The 1938 midterm elections delivered a sharp blow to President Roosevelt’s coalition. Republicans made significant gains in both the House and Senate, while conservative Democrats also increased their influence. This newly empowered bloc, wary of the expanding federal government and ballooning deficits, has begun pushing hard for rolling back New Deal programs and cutting federal spending. They argue that the nation cannot afford continued massive intervention, warning that too much government stifles free enterprise and individual initiative. Roosevelt faces a Congress less willing to fund relief and public works, complicating efforts to sustain economic recovery and social programs. The battle over the New Deal’s future is set to intensify in the months ahead."

Budget hawks argue that ongoing spending is unsustainable and threatens the nation’s financial stability. Conservative lawmakers push for tighter controls and cuts to relief efforts, seeking to scale back the federal government’s role in the economy. Public opinion is divided: some Americans welcome the prospect of smaller government and reduced taxes, while others fear losing vital support during uncertain times. The political tug-of-war over the New Deal’s future is intensifying."
