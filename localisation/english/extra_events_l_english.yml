 ### GERMANY ###

 germany.129.t:0 "Reichskommissariat Norwegen"
 germany.129.d:0 "The need by National socialist Germany to occupy and incorporate Norway into a German empire came about for two principal reasons. The first was that in 1940, Germany was dependent on natural resources, mainly iron ore, being sent from Sweden to Germany. If Norway allowed Allied vessels to pass through its waters, they could potentially blockade the trade routes. The second reason was that Germany feared an allied attack, either using Norway as a staging area, or moving through Sweden.\nCollaborationist support came from the pro-National-socialist Nasjonal Samling ("National Gathering" or "National Unification") party led by Vidkun Quisling, who was allowed by Adolf Hitler to form a Norwegian government under German supervision. Quisling became Minister President of Norway in 1942 but lacked any real power. Reichskommissar Terboven held control over Norway as a governor, and all the military forces stationed in Norway were under German command."

The newly occupied Second Polish Republic was split into three zones: the General Government in its centre, Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany in the west, and Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union in the east. The administration of the General Government was composed entirely of German officials, with the intent that the area was to be colonized by Germanic settlers who would reduce the local Polish population to the level of serfs."

 germany.133.d:0 "At the time of the invasion of Yugoslavia by Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler was uneasy with Mussolini's agenda of creating a puppet Croatian state, and preferred that areas outside of Italian territorial aims become part of Hungary as an autonomous territory. This would appease Nazi Germany's ally Hungary and its nationalist territorial claims. Germany's position on Croatia changed after its invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941. The invasion was spearheaded by a strong German invasion force which was largely responsible for the capture of Yugoslavia. Military forces from other Axis powers, including Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria made few gains during the invasion. The invasion was precipitated by the need for German forces to reach Greece to save Italian forces, which were failing on the battlefield against the Greek armed forces. Upon rescuing Italian forces in Greece and having conquered Yugoslavia and Greece almost single-handedly, Hitler became frustrated with Mussolini and Italy's military incompetence. Germany improved relations with the Ustaše and supported the NDH claims to annex the Adriatic Coast in order reduce Italy's planned territorial gains. Nevertheless, Italy annexed a significant central portion of Dalmatia and various Adriatic Islands. This was not what had been agreed with Pavelić prior to the invasion; Italy had expected to annex all of Dalmatia as part of its irredentist claims."

The idea of someone who ought to be a figure of admiration and idolisation putting his own interests first must be dealt with quickly and efficiently.

No matter though, a long honest and hard-working sentence to a labour camp should afford him the time to contemplate his actions and in time come to see the error of his ways.

Either way, such rumours, be they of truth or not must be investigated and dealt with promptly. The navy may not be the largest of our branches, but dissent of any kind, navy or not, must be squashed quickly and efficiently before it spreads into the army. Then we will have a severe problem on our hands. We shall start with bringing in various junior officers in for “questioning” in regards to any suspicious activity they have noticed while on duty. This shouldn’t take too long, and it should be best if this ‘problem’ stays fairly under wraps, the boss is already paranoid enough in regards to the army as it is.

 soviet.108.d:0 "Upon inspecting a painting made by a formerly well respected painter, an inspector noticed that the painter had chosen a motive that was not touched upon by the state-approved standards for what a painting may contain. Necessarily it wasn't harmful and the painting was quite innocent in itself, but the fact that the artist had chosen to defy the very clear and numerous restrictions is high treason."

 soviet.109.d:0 "A poem was to be published in a state-approved magazine, but the publicist had called in to an NKVD office to report that he suspected that a poem was an encrypted message to a government outside of the Soviet Union. After an investigation and a quick trial the poet in question was judged to have committed an act of high treason."

The athlete of course denied ever having any of those contents within his sport bags, and that his trainer could verify that he had never engaged in any such activities.

 soviet.113.t:0 "A Normal Day in the Union"
 soviet.113.d:0 "Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbours, filled up the horizon of their minds. To keep them in control was not difficult. A few agents of the NKVD moved always among them, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating any individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party. It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice. It was not necessary to know much. So long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance."

 soviet.118.d:0 "Despite the odd hitch here and there, some possible paperwork vanishing into thin air (or the nearest steel furnace) and some very hardworking, dedicated people almost working themselves to death, coupled with various odd handshakes, granting of favours and back scratching, there has been no doubt that this five-year plan was a roaring success. A grand celebration is due to take place in the morning, and you shall surely be rewarded as a hero of the Soviet Union for dragging Russia’s antiquated industry into the 20th century. No longer will the Soviet Union be subject to ridicule by capitalistic western powers. This century will be Russia’s, and it was completely down to you and the noble sacrifices you had to endure to achieve this. "

 soviet.119.t:0 "Stalin Summons you to his Dacha"
 soviet.119.d:0 "Sometimes when it comes to dealing with the Man of Steel himself, the odd result here and there doesn’t hurt. But in this case, those results were far below his expectations. You are summoned to Stalin’s office (effective immediately), and there the man sits comfortably in his chair, puffing away at his pipe, enormous plumes of smoke obscuring most of his face following your entrance through half-closed eyes. He gestures to the chair on the other side of his desk. Maybe this wasn’t as bad as you had feared.  Oh how very were you indeed. Stalin leaps to his feet and bends over the entire length of the desk until his face is no less than a foot away from yours. His eyes wide with a severely unwelcoming glower. You go to open your mouth, but no sooner have your lips even parted, Stalin tears you to shreds. Beginning with the typical accusations of being a traitor and an agent working against the Motherland, to outright tirades regarding how well you have been treated and why would you go against your home, your family, your leader.  Eventually Stalin manages to calm himself down and seats himself down to top up his pipe. His eyes return to a passive, half closed state as he focuses on the pipe bowl in front of him. After what feels like ages he finally announces that you will not punished too severely, but your family will be placed under very heavy scrutiny and should you fail again, well, you will find out. And with that he points the door, whereupon a guard opens it and ‘helps’ you out. "

Our Red Army now needs aircraft like the air it breathes, like the bread it eats. Our aircraft plants produce an insufficient amount of aircraft... It is a mockery of the Red Army... I ask you not to try the government’s patience, and demand that you manufacture more aircraft.\n\nThis is my final warning. Stalin"

 soviet.121.d:0 "The fascist were brave indeed for thinking they could march into the very heart of our Motherland and get away with it. It was as if knowing that they were fighting for what would be the ultimate last effort, a great strength befell the army. Was it self-belief? Supernatural? Self-preservation? We will never know, either way, we fought for the future, will destroy the invader and long shall we be united and free!"

The high command? Gone. Everything is just gone. The last hope in the world has gone. We have lost, and with it, the world has now lost. The world is now about to plunge into an uncertain future, one possible devoid of anything as the fashist boot cruelly oppresses any attempt to stand up to them. Failure was not an option and yet somehow it happened anyway. "

 soviet.123.d:0 "The siege of Leningrad has been one of unparalleled brutality and hardship. Stranded between our Finnish enemies and the German fashist, there was no escape for anyone. The only way out of hell, was through it, and that was exactly what you did. You lifted that terrible siege and showed those bastards that even in our darkest hour, the city which bears the name of the great Lenin, will never break, not to filthy monarchists or monstrous fascists.

 soviet.124.d:0 "The harsh cold of a Baltic winter is creeping in, bodies line the streets, their faces contorted with unimageable expressions of horror. This ancient city will become nothing more than a ruin, haunted by those who died attempting to hold it. Their wailing echoing throughout for all time. A reminder of what price failure is met with, a reminder that sometimes, some things are better left forgotten for their memory is too painful to recollect."

Now, however, is not the time for celebration, it is not the time for rest, it is not the time to dwell on those we have lost. Now it is the time to push, harder and more ferociously than ever before. We WILL drive the Nazi bastards back to where the pizda himself sits on his throne of skulls and anguish."

All the blood and sacrifice up until this point has all been for nothing. The fashist will march through this sacred city, defiling the very foundations with every step taken. Any survivors left in the city will have no mercy from those bastards. The screams of women and children will echo throughout the Motherland, and you failed in preventing it."
