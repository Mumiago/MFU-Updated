 armor_tech_1:0 "Improved Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_1_desc:0 "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 armor_tech_2:0 "Advanced Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_2_desc:0 "While the limit of deployed anti-tank guns has likely been reached, a new generation of tanks will carry more advanced weaponry, which is able to pierce any current level of protection at long range. Thankfully the advances in metalurgy allow us to produce more complicated and thicker armor."
 armor_tech_3:0 "Modernized Armor Protection"
 armor_tech_3_desc:0 "During the war, the threats faced by tanks have multiplied, from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, dedicated tank destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armor.

 engine_tech_1_desc:0 "Where the tanks of the Great War were slow, lumbering beasts, the modern tank relies very much on speed and mobility to achieve victory."
 engine_tech_2:0 "Improved Engine"
 engine_tech_2_desc:0 "With bigger guns and heavier armor, the new generation of tanks requires a more powerful engine to remain mobile."
 engine_tech_3:0 "Advanced Engine"
 engine_tech_3_desc:0 "Mechanized warfare is a form of combat that requires fast decision making and fast movement of troops and supplies. If our tanks are to carry modern weapons and enough armor to survive on the battlefield, they require powerful engines to keep up with the motorized infantry."
 engine_tech_4:0 "Modern Engine"
 engine_tech_4_desc:0 "The numerous new additions to tanks made necessary by modern warfare have increased the weight of the vehicle substantially. To move all that mass around, we require engines that have a lot of power behind them."

 tank_wheeled_suspension:0 "Wheeled Suspension"
 tank_wheeled_suspension_desc:0 "Derived from a truck chassis, this suspension is very limited in its carrying capacity and has limited cross-country performance, but has the advantage of being very cheap to make."
 tank_half_track_suspension:0 "Half-track Suspension"
 tank_half_track_suspension_desc:0 "A hybrid between a fully-tracked vehicle and a regular wheeled suspension, this setup has a pair of wheels up front for steering and a tracked rear axle to improve cross-country performance. While limited in its carrying capacity, it is still cheaper than a fully-tracked design."
 squeezebore_adaptor:0 "Squeeze-bore Adaptor"
 squeezebore_adaptor_desc:0 "A special adaptor at the end of the gun lowers the diameter of the barrel and squeezes a shell down to a smaller caliber. This significantly increases muzzle velocity and thereby the penetration power of the gun. It does require special ammunition made from rare materials."

 auto_loader:0 "Semi-Automatic Loading"
 auto_loader_desc:0 "A semiautomatic loader system helps the loader by lifting the shells to the level of the breech automatically, after which after the loader pushes the round into the breech. Even if adding both expense and complication to the vehicle, it increases the vehicles rate of fire, and especially helps with keeping it up in longer engagements."
 auto_loader2:0 "Improved Autoloader"
 auto_loader2_desc:0 "With the experience gained from the earlier mechanisms, we are able to develop more effective, and especially more reliable autoloaders."

As an added benefit the reduced size obviously creates a harder target to hit and allows for more effective armor layouts. Also we can obviously just issue height limit for tankers."
 tank_phone:0 "Tank-Infantry Telephone"
 tank_phone_desc:0 "Communication between infantry and tanks may be possible via radio and other means. However, it is more efficient and reliable to provide a tank phone mounted typically on the rear of the tank in a small box that contains a standard telephone handset which infantrymen may use to speak directly to the tank commander. Infantrymen may thus direct the tank's fire, which they are better placed to do as the tank crew will typically have their vision impeded by being buttoned up within the tank. "
 frontal_engine:0 "Front Mounted Engine"
 frontal_engine_desc:0 "Mounting our tanks engine in front of the fighting compartment allows for more protection of the crew, and easier mounting of longer guns. This however makes the vehicle clumsier on the offense, and maintanance more difficult."
 mechanical_charging:0 "Supercharger"
 mechanical_charging_desc:0 "Majority of current aircraft use mechanically driven superchargers to boost the power output of their engines. Why wouldn't we be able to mount a one on a tank engine?"

 FC:0 "Electro-mechanical Firecontrol"
 FC_desc:0 "With the recent advances we are able to create complex electro-mechanical firecontrol systems for our tanks, where the gunner can control the gun and fire the weapons via simple control handle. The electrification of turret controls also allows for the commander to take control of the turret when required."
 austerity_powertrain:0 "War Austerity Transmission"
 austerity_powertrain_desc:0 "With restrictions on imports caused by the war, the lack of rare materials has been capping our tank transmission production. However with some sacrifices, we can reduce the amount rare metals required in transmission production."

 armour_sloping2_desc:0 "Mounting our armor plates at angles where possible increases our tanks armors effectiveness, even if a lot of the front armor is still almost vertical"
 sloped_armor:0 "Sloped Armor"
 armour_sloping3_desc:0 "Designing our tanks entire front plate and even the sides to be mounted at an oblique angle increases the armor effectiveness and can even cause the shells to bounce off with a reasonable change. However a leap like this in construction of tanks armor increases the production expenses."
 advanced_sloped_armor:0 "Advanced Sloped Armor"
 armour_sloping4_desc:0 "Experience gained from the conflict clearly states that to protect our tanks from most modern AT guns armor sloped at regular angles ends up too heavy to be practical. By extreme angles and innovative shapes we can maximize the effectiveness of our steel armor."

Even if adding both expense and complication to the vehicle, it increases the vehicles rate of fire, and especially helps with keeping it up in longer engagements."
 autoloader2:0 "Automatic Loading"
 autoloader2_desc:0 "While large caliber autoloading mechanisms are still in their infancy, making our tanks gun load automatically allows unmatched burst-fire potential and a reduced crew count. The small size of the ammo rack available to the autoloader and the unreliability of the cutting edge mechanisms limits potential for longer engagements."
 small_gun:0 "Small Cannon"
 small_gun_desc:0 "A small and cheap cannon, able to fire both anti-infantry and anti-armor rounds. Its small caliber limits its usefulness."
