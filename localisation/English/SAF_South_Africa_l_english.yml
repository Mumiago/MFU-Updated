POLITICS_J_B_M_HERTZOG_DESC:0 "In foreign policy, Hertzog favoured a policy of distance from the British Empire and, as an Germanophile, was sympathetic towards revising the international system set up by the Treaty of Versailles in favour of lessening the burdens imposed on Germany.\n\nHertzog's cabinet in the 1930s was divided between a pro-British group led by the Anglophile Smuts, and a pro-German group led by Oswald Pirow, the openly pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic minister of defence, with Hertzog occupying a middle position.\n\nHertzog had an autocratic style of leadership, expecting the cabinet to approve his decisions rather than to discuss them and, as a consequence, the cabinet only met intermittently.\n\nFrom 1934 onward, South Africa was dominated by an informal "inner cabinet" consisting of Hertzog, Smuts, Pirow, the Finance minister N.C. Havenga, and Native Affairs minister P.G.W. Grobler.Generally, the "inner cabinet" would meet in private and whatever decision they reached in their meetings would be presented to the cabinet to endorse with no discussion."
POLITICS_JAN_SMUTS_DESC:0 "Jan Smuts represents one of the perceived strengths of the British Empire, its ability to turn former enemies into friends. Having served as a Boer general in the 2nd Boer War against the British he has since enthusiastically sought to promote his once perceived oppressors.\n\nUnder the wing of General Botha he pushed for the 1912 Union of South Act and led British forces in the East Africa campaign during the Great war.\n\nHe continues to campaign for closer relations with the British Empire and is commonly referred to in Whitehall as the "Hero of the Empire".\n\nIn terms of his vision for the future of South Africa, Smuts very much wants to pursue a future originally envisaged by Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes' vision was the establishment of a federated colony across Southern Africa that would rival Canada and Australia in term of population and development. Rhodes never adequately described what role the native population would play in his vision but it has endured regardless.\n\nSmuts is of the same mind and still yearns for South Africa to gain sovereignty over the High Commission territories and the British colonies in Central Africa. These British territories might become the price of South African support in the forthcoming war."

 tfv_south_africa.1.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Proposes a Southern African Federation"
 tfv_south_africa.1.d:0 "As we struggle with military coverage of the entire Empire, [From.GetNameDef] has approached us about an administrative revision to the British Empire in Southern and Central Africa. [FROM.GetLeader] has outlined his vision for a Southern African Federation, modeled along the lines of the Canadian Confederation, which would encompass South africa, the High Commission Territories and our colonies in central africa. They have announced their intention to discuss this proposal with politicians in these territories, but have asked if the british government would endorse the proposal and promote the idea with the respective regional administrations. How should we respond?"
 tfv_south_africa.1.a:0 "Our african colonies should be consulted about closer integration."
 tfv_south_africa.1.b:0 "Promote the Southern African Federation proposal within British Africa."
 tfv_south_africa.1.c:0 "Sadly we cannot endorse this idea."

 tfv_south_africa.2.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] approves consultation with British Africa"
 tfv_south_africa.2.d:0 "With growing commitments across the globe and increasingly stretched resources, [From.GetNameDef] has agreed that her African colonies could be consulted about further increasing their relationship with [ROOT.GetNameDef]. We should prepare to dispatch delegations to undertake these consultations."

 tfv_south_africa.3.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
 tfv_south_africa.3.d:0 "Citing a lack of direct threat to her colonies in Africa, [From.GetNameDef] has made it very clear that they do not intend to hand over the administration of her holdings to us."
 tfv_south_africa.3.a:0 "Don't they trust us?"
 tfv_south_africa.4.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Endorses the Proposed Federation"
 tfv_south_africa.4.d:0 "After long deliberation, the British government has agreed to the federation proposal presented by our delegation. Britain's Southern and Central African colonies will have the final say on their own future. It will likely appear to be a seemingly radical idea to the colonial governments, so the British government has begun an assurance us that they have the commitment of [From.GetNameDef] that they will preserve our ability to handle domestic affairs under this new arrangement. Under this new agreement, the colonies will need to be consulted and must agree to the proposal, and must be granted the freedom to manage their own internal affairs."

 tfv_south_africa.5.desc:0 "A delegation from [From.GetNameDef] have proposed the inclusion of [Root.GetNameDef] in a new Southern African Federation, modelled on the Canadian Confederation. While a seemingly radical idea, the British government has assured us that they have the commitment of [From.GetNameDef] that they will preserve our ability to handle domestic affairs under this new arrangement.\n\nIt is obvious however that we would have to sacrifice control of our foreign policy to [From.GetAdjective] officials."

 tfv_south_africa.7.a:0 "Thats a shame."

 tfv_south_africa.130.t:0 "[SAF.GetNameDefCap] requests that HMS Cumberland be transferred"
 tfv_south_africa.130.d:0 "Members of the South African Royal Naval Reserve have been seconded to the Royal Navy for several years now and have served their roles admirably. Most of the secondees were assigned to HMS Cumberland which was at the time operating in the South Atlantic Station under Commodore Harwood. Given the increasing risk of German, Italian and Japanese surface raiders operating off the Cape of Good Hope, the South African Naval Force has requested that HMS Cumberland, along with its predominantly South African crew be transferred to their Command.\n\nWe do have to bear in mind that refusing this suggestion may lead to the majority of the South African crew applying to transfer back to the SANF to be closer to home after so many years on foreign stations."
 tfv_south_africa.130.a:0 "A worthy proposal. The Cape must be Defended."
 tfv_south_africa.130.b:0 "Quite frankly we still need her elsewhere"
 tfv_south_africa.131.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] approves the transfer request"
 tfv_south_africa.131.d:0 "The British Government has formerly approved the transfer of HMS Cumberland to the South African Naval Force. The Admiralty has been instructed to make the necessary arrangements so that she can operate out of Simon's town naval base."
 tfv_south_africa.131.a:0 "Bring on the Graf Spee!"
 tfv_south_africa.132.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] declines the transfer request"
 tfv_south_africa.132.d:0 "The British Government has formerly declined the transfer of HMS Cumberland to the South African Naval Force. The Admiralty has reportedly cited the difficulty of making the necessary arrangements without compromising the security of other stations."

 tfv_south_africa.133.title:0 "Conscription of South African Airways"
 tfv_south_africa.133.desc:0 "The government funded expansion of South African Airways saw the airline buy a number of German passenger aircraft. With the threat of war bearing down on South Africa's borders we must conscript these aircraft for service in the SAAF.\n\nWhat role should we assign these mutli-engined aircraft to?"
 tfv_south_africa.133.a:0 "Form them into SAAF bomber squadrons."
 tfv_south_africa.133.b:0 "Use them for supply and liason duties."
 tfv_south_africa.134.title:0 "[ROOT.GetAdjective] Airforce Doctrine"
 tfv_south_africa.134.desc:0 "Air warfare theorists are markedly divided on the future role that aircraft will play in conflicts. The [ROOT.GetAdjective] air force commanders are split on the subject as well.\n\nSome follow the school advocated by the Italian General Douhet, whose writings articultaed fleets of bombers destroying the enemies' lands without the need for costly ground warfare.\nOthers advocate the tactical uses of aircraft to support ground campaigns rather than replacing them.\n\nA decision on the matter needs to be made so that [ROOT.GetAdjective] military planners can begin developing further doctrinal innovations. Which school of thought should we follow?"
 tfv_south_africa.134.a:0 "Douhet's strategic destruction will win the war"
 tfv_south_africa.134.b:0 "Supporting the battlefield is the key to victory"

 tfv_south_africa.135.desc:0 "Our proposed purchase of Hurricane fighters from Hawker Aircraft Ltd. has prompted questions regarding the missions that the aircraft will be expected to undertake for the South African Air Force. If provided with the correct specifications, Hawker can either specialise the aircraft to fulfill an air superiority or a ground attach role.\n\nWhat should our specification be?"
 tfv_south_africa.135.a:0 "We need air superiority fighters"

 tfv_south_africa.142.desc:0 "It is quite apparent that our League of Nations Mandate will likely end once the league of nations ceases to be of international importance. It is of vital security interest that we do not let it fall under the influence of a hostile foreign power. Prime Minister Jan Smuts is in favour of integrating the region into the South African Union as part of our manifest destiny. Achieving this will require convincing the great powers of the rapidly emerging United Nations, that we are worthy of being ceded the region.\n\nHis chief adviser meanwhile, Jan Hofmeyr, is more inclined towards granting the region self-government under our protection so that we can more easily prove to the world that we have the region's interests at heart.\n\nOnly one of these policies can be taken forward. Which path shall we set for the region?"

 tfv_south_africa.143.desc:0 "After a frenzy of activity by the South African civil service, we are now in a position to hand over administration of South-west africa to a new regional administration to be known as The Namib Protectorate. The protectorate's administrative and economic duties will be undertaken by south african civil servants on secondment to the new administration until they can provide their own cohort of administrators.\n\nSimilarly, and in practise with all other nations of the British Empire, the Namib Protectorate will swear loyalty to the British Crown and have a governor general appointed as His Majesty's representative. For the period of transition Nicolaas Jacobus de Wet, current transitioning from the south african Court of Appeal to the office of Chief Justice, will assume the duties of Governor-General until future arrangements are made."
 tfv_south_africa.143.a:0 "The Namib Protectorate is established"
 tfv_south_africa.143.b:0 "Assuming direct control."
 tfv_south_africa.144.title:0 "The Namib Protectorate"
 tfv_south_africa.144.desc:0 "In a surprisingly quick turn of events South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts announced to parliament the establishment of a self-governing administration in the former German colony of South-West Africa.\n\nWhile still under effective sounth african administration this announcement is being viewed as a major diversion in policy from the segregationist tide that had seemingly been sweeping over South African society.\n\nWhether this leads to additional changes within South Africa itself remains to be seen."

 tfv_south_africa.145.desc:0 "An emmissary from the South African Government has arrived in the [Root.GetAdjective] capital, bearing a letter addressed personally to [ROOT.GetLeader] from [From.GetLeader].\n\nThe letter concerns south african efforts to annex their League of Mations Mandate of South West Africa into the rest of the South African Union.\n\nThey are desperately seeking international support for this move and will likely only proceed if they receive the support from most of the major allied powers.\n\nShould we agree to let them annex the region or should we not gove our blessing?"

 tfv_south_africa.147.a:0 "Fine... We'll contact another government then."

 smuts.1.t:0 "Prime Minister Hertzog Resigns"
 smuts.1.desc:0 "Prime Minister Hertzog has always staunchly opposed the breakout of hostilities between the Union of South Africa and the German Reich, instead pursuing a more independent foreign policy seperate from the British Empire. Now that war has broken out, he had attempted to gain a parliamentary majority for a policy of neutrality, but was defeated both in the cabinet and in the commons (the latter by 80 votes to 67).\n\nWith the Dominion of South Africa on a course to fight loyally at the side of the motherland, Prime Minister Hertzog wished to hold a gneral election on the subject. The Governor General however, wanting to avoid a general election so soon after the last one, refused. Hertzog has therefore seen it fit to resign and the Governor General, Sir Patrick Duncan, has called on Jan Smut to form a government instead.\n\nThe pro-British faction of the United Party along with a coalition from the Labour and Dominion Parties will be behind Jan Smuts as he now leads both South Africa and the United Party to war."
 smuts.1.a:0 "A Hero of the Empire returns"
 smuts.2.title:0 "The End of the Fusion Government"
 smuts.2.desc:0 "Leader of the South African Party, General Jan Smuts stood before parliament today and announced that he and the rest of the former members of the South African party could no longer participate in the fusion government with Hertzog's National Party. Citing the increasingly anti-british rhetoric of the fellow members of Hertzog's inner cabinet, Smuts proclaimed that he would invite his loyal followers in the United Party to renounce their alleigance and instead join the newly re-established South African party. The overwhelming majority did so, and crossed the floor of the parliament to take their (now quite frankly scarce) seats in the opposition.\n\nThe Leader of the Dominion party, Sir Charles Stallard, and his small number of MPs jubilantly cheered this significant act of parliamentary theatre and gestured for Smuts and his followers to sit alongside them.\n\nThe significance of these dramatic events has rippled across South African society and has brought out varying emotions and opinions from the Boer and British descended populations. For the majority of the native african population there is no visible reason to rejoice or condemn these events. Life goes on regardless."
 smuts.2.a:0 "Smuts knows how to send a message"
 smuts.3.title:0 "Coalition talks underway"
 smuts.3.desc:0 "The South African media are abuzz today with the news that the re-established South African party have begun coalition talks with the Labour and Dominion parties. All the parties have some competing interests and agendas with one another, but none would benefit from a continued National Party led government.\n\nAs all of the parties are keen to maintain strong links with the British Empire it will likely prove to be the glue that binds them all together."
 smuts.3.a:0 "Onwards to parliament"
 smuts.4.title:0 "The fall of the National Party"
 smuts.4.desc:0 "In the South African Parliament today a truly extraordinary set of events unfolded. As Prime Minister Hertzog spoke to promote his amendment to the Representation of Native's Act, General Smuts rose and called on the speaker of the house, to divide the chamber to vote on a motion of no confidence in the Hertzog government.\n\nThis move, clearly timed by Smuts to have the maximum impact on the distracted Hertzog, saw the government defeated by a mere eight votes.\n\nWishing to avoid having a general election so close to the next scheduled one, the Governor General made the bold and controversial move of asking General Smuts to form a coalition government instead.\n\nSmuts happily obliged and now leads a coalition government with a slim majority. The British descended population is in celebration this evening, but their Afrikaan neighbours have varying opinions, with some pleased to see a change a government, but others looking towards other radical parties to see to their interests."
 smuts.4.a:0 "We had better keep an eye on that Malan chap"
 smuts.5.title:0 "Jan Hofmeyr refuses to vote for the amendment"
 smuts.5.desc:0 "When the United party was formed in 1934, Hertzog became leader of the new party and thus remained Prime Minister. Smuts was his deputy. As a compromise the two men split their new cabinet down the middle. Hofmeyr was one of six who Smuts nominated for the cabinet, with Hofmeyr being awarded the portfolios for Education, Interior, and Public Health.\n\nSmuts did a great deal to hold the fusion government together which involved a great show of capitulation towards Hertzog's legislative agenda, including the amendment to the Representation of Natives Act. Hofmeyr was not inclined to behave in this manner and showed an almost inflexible adherence to principle. So when other cabinet members leant over backwards in the interests of staying in government, Hofmeyr stood alone to oppose destructive legislation such as the laws aimed at removing the black franchise, steadfastly refusing to vote in favour of it despite being a member of the cabinet.\n\nThis has undoubtedly been a very public, if small, display of disunity in the United Party."
 smuts.5.a:0 "Standing up for his principles"
 smuts.6.title:0 "The Representation of Natives Bill is Defeated"
 smuts.6.desc:0 "The South Africa Party has defeated the bill put forward by Hertzog to provide a rallying point for our supporters. The issue has created division within the party though, with the majority of our supporters wanting the right to vote to be extended to every white person, even if that meant having to give ground on giving the vote to south africa's other populations.\n\nWe should grant enfranchisement to everyone in the white population as this will almost certainly pass through parliament. The question is whether we should attach to this measure a proclomation of intent to bring the vote to all races? It would be very popular with the african and asiatic population, but will be bitterly received by the majority of the Afrikaans."

 smuts.7.desc:0 "South African Prime Minister, Jan Smuts, addressed a combined session of the British House of Lords and the House of Commons within the British Parliament on the personal invitation of Winston Churchill.\nSmuts is no stranger to public speaking, but was clearly humbled by the opportunity to address, as he put it, "The mother of all parliaments".\nIn his speech he made the case that;\n"This war is a new crusade, a new fight to the death, for man's rights and liberties."\nThe speech was met with frequent applause in the Palace of Westminster and when finished, Smuts was met with a (rather out of tune) rendition of "He's a jolly good fellow" by the parliamentarians."

Even if africans work at below market rates, they benefit from a significant increase in their standard of living, but at the expense of the standard of living of the white working class population, the key voting base of the former National Party.\n\nThe former National party members of the United party are calling for action to be taken to safeguard the current standard of living of this working class. Two policies are being proposed for the purpose.\nOne proposal is for all races to be granted equal wages, a seemingly generous notion but one that would render africans unable to compete with white workers due to their lack of formal education.\nThe other policy would introduce a mandatory minimum wage across all sectors of the south african economy, at a rate well below the average wages in industry, which might incentivise native africans to look for other work and reduce competitive pressure on industrial workers.\n\nThe majority of the industrial workers want the wage equality measure, while buisness owners are lobbying (reluctantly) towards a minimum wage to ensure access to african labour."

ESCOM was created to supply electricity throughout South Africa but in particular to the mines, industries and the electrification of the railways. It was a commercial success, South Africa was assured of sufficient inexpensive power for its fast-growing industries and ESCOM was able to pay back the state loan after 10 years.\n\nHis next major task was the establishment of the Iron and Steel Corporation of South Africa (ISCOR) as a type of public utility, and he became its chairman from 1925. At that time there was a lack of people knowledgeable in the manufacture of steel in South Africa.\nVan der Bijl overcame this obstacle by appointing a committee of international iron and steel experts from Britain, America, Germany and Sweden who arranged for the training of South Africans, who had completed their BSc degrees in engineering, at steelworks in Britain, Germany, Holland, Sweden, USA and Canada. ISCOR was also a commercial success and provided inexpensive steel for South Africa from 1934.\n\nDuring the Second World War he was appointed as Director-General of War Supplies and subsequently Director of Supplies in the forerunner of the Armaments Corporation of South Africa (ARMSCOR).\nSouth Africa was an important supplier of spares, guns, ammunition, bombs, armoured cars, clothing, boots, blankets and canned foods to the Allies."

As a compromise the two men split their new cabinet down the middle. Hofmeyr was one of six who Smuts nominated for the cabinet, with Hofmeyr being awarded the portfolios for Education, Interior, and Public Health.\n\nSmuts did a great deal to hold the fusion government together which involved a great show of capitulation towards Hertzog's legislative agenda, including the amendment to the Representation of Natives Act. Hofmeyr was not inclined to behave in this manner and showed an almost inflexible adherence to principle. So when other cabinet members leant over backwards in the interests of staying in government, Hofmeyr stood alone to oppose destructive legislation such as the laws aimed at removing the black franchise, steadfastly refusing to vote in favour of it despite being a member of the cabinet. This was undoubtedly been a very public display of disunity in the United Party.\n\n When Smuts became Prime Minister in 1939, Hofmeyr was approached to rejoin the cabinet and accepted the offer without hesitation and became the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Education, and soon became Smuts' closest advisor. He effectively acted as Prime Minister during the Second World War, as Smuts was reguarly involved in organising the British Imperial War effort and could not dedicate time to domestic concerns. This multi-tasking of jobs had become a habit continued throughout Hofmeyr's career. In cabinet he could at times handle six or seven ministerial portfolios simultaneously, even while acting as prime minister during Smuts's regular absences from South Africa.\n\nThis work ethic would lead to burnout and was catastrophic for Hofmeyr's health, with Hofmeyr sadly dying at the age of only 54 in Johannesburg on 3 December 1948."

Currently they are entitled to only serve within South Arica, but their reluctance could indicate a lack of loyalty to the union.\n\nTo ensure that all troops who are fighting in our divisions abroad are loyal we will mandate that an "Africa oath" be taken. Agreement to take this oath will be met with an additional stipend to soldier's monthly pay.

These patriotic women will not be allowed into the combat arms but will be able to undertake vital functions in the supporting and clerical arms of the UDF, SANF, and SAAF.\n\nThis will also free up critical manpower to fill gaps in the combat arms."

SAF_reguage_the_otavibahn_desc:0 "The original German administrators of south-west africa built a dedicated small guage railway to connect their inland mines in Tsumeb with their ramshackle port at Swakopmund. Rather annoyingly they built it as a 600mm guage line rather than the more common 610mm (3ft 6in) cape guage present across the rest of southern africa.

SAF_universal_suffrage_desc:0 "It is simply untenable for [ROOT.GetName] to continue with minority rule by the white population and any attempt to do so would likely be unsustainable. Instead we should seize the initiative and look to build a new form of Pan-South Africanism which includes all men and women of all races. Providing everyone with the vote is the first major step on our path to proving our commitment to all South Africans."

This cultural change should be built upon the legacy of the Zulu war, which is remembered by the heroism and fighting prowess displayed by both the British and Zulu soldiers that battled in the plains of Natal. "Equality under arms" will be its new watchword."

SAF_south_african_railways_desc:0 "The South African Railways company needs to be expanded, not least so that we can provide work for the large share of our population who are unemployed because of the great depression. Bands of youth can be trained there, and given the necessary skills to both work in the country and serve overseas. This will be financed with loans from the government but they should eventually be repaid."

SAF_expand_the_mining_industry_desc:0 "South Africa’s mineral wealth is legendary, and we’ve only just begun to tap its deep reserves of gold, chromium and platinum. The difficulty is that the international market is not hungry for such resources. To ensure that this vital industry remains active we will undertake efforts to keep these mines active and developing their extraction methods. AMCOR will be at the centre of these efforts."
SAF_infrastructure_effort:0 "Expand the Cape Guage Network"

SAF_solidify_south_african_airways_desc:0 "South Africa's first airline has had a difficult few years during the depression. Demand and willing investors has been in short supply and the company may collapse. A government grant, contingent on the establishment of flights across the Union to ease buisness, should be offered to the airline. This should also assist our economic recovery. Time is money after all."
SAF_protect_cattle_industry:0 "Protecting the Cattle Industry"
SAF_protect_cattle_industry_desc:0 "The great depression has completely sunk demand for our beef exports. Our cattle ranchers face bankruptcy as a result and are only surviving through domestic sales.

SAF_food_production_agreement_desc:0 "With Britain at war once again she requires a huge amount of food to feed the armies of the Empire. This represents a major opportunity for our farmers and we should seize upon the chance to both improve their economic outlook and contribute to the war effort. While it may not be heroic, farming is crucial to winning a war, and the cattle boom it shall bring will reduce the costs of leather."
SAF_expand_the_rand_mines:0 "Expand the Rand Mines"
SAF_expand_the_rand_mines_desc:0 "The Rand Mines are home to the most lucrative gold seams in the world, attracting the worlds major mining companies into the Witwatersrand.

SAF_maintain_the_marriage_of_maize_and_gold_desc:0 "South Africa was built on two industries, agriculture and mining, both of which came to form the bedrock of our economy. While the other Dominions may focus on heavy industry as their contributions, we can provide far greater assistance through our strengths in farming and valuable minerals. This marriage of maize and gold will see us through these dark days and provide for us into the future."
SAF_agricultural_diversification:0 "Agricultural Diversification"
SAF_agricultural_diversification_desc:0 "Although our agricultural industries form the basis of our economy, we have grown far too dependent on a small number of crop types, leaving us very susceptible to crop diseases. To build resilience in our economy for the future we must encourage supporting industries and increased diversification in our agricultural sector. Wine and Cheese are a good place to start and they may even become popular."

SAF_industrial_development_corporation:0 "Industrial Development Corporation"
SAF_industrial_development_corporation_desc:0 "South Africa's heavy industry is well behind those in Canada and Australia due to our successful mining and agriculture sector. To support the growth of our heavy industry a new organisation should be established to provide capital funding and technical assistance to new industrial ventures. Given time, this new programme will hopefully bring about rapid growth in our industrial sector."
SAF_armament_effort:0 "Establish Local Equipment Contracts"
SAF_armament_effort_desc:0 "South Africa is safe from invasion by any foreign power, but also remote from its allies.

SAF_south_african_steel:0 "Iron and Steel Corporation of South Africa"
SAF_south_african_steel_desc:0 "With ever greater amounts of coal and iron being extracted by south african mining firms over recent years, we can now become a competitor in the heavy industry market.

SAF_pretoria_arms:0 "Expand ISCOR"
SAF_pretoria_arms_desc:0 "The recently opened ISCOR steel works in Pretoria has made a success of focusing on the production of heavy plate for construction projects. Hendrik van der Bijl has been at the forefront of this success story and is eager to open a second plant to meet the needs of the emerging war economy.
