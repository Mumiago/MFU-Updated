Duncan, a staunch loyalist to the British Crown, had served as the representative of the King in South Africa during a time of great political and military upheaval. His sudden death has left the nation in shock and uncertainty."

##### IDEAS #####

SAF_afrikaner_employment:0 "Securing Afrikaner Employment"
SAF_afrikaner_employment_desc:0 "The National Party's electoral coalitions were historically held together by a voting coalition of Boer Nationalist and labour parties. These labour parties were focused on ensuring that their members (almost exclusively working class men of European, mainly Boer, origin) had secure employment and did not have to compete with native workers. These coalition interests encouraged the United, and later the National, parties to pursue increasingly segregationist labour policies which pushed South Africa well on the course towards the abhorent system of Apartheid. It also tied down much of this manpower pool into economic activity, leaving fewer men available for the armed services."

SAF_committed_to_no_conscription:0 "No Overseas Conscription"
SAF_federal_integration_tfv:0 "Preparing for the South African Federation"

SAF_legacy_of_great_depression:0 "Remnants of the Great Depression"
SAF_legacy_of_great_depression_desc:0 "South Africa was hit hard by the effects of the 1929 US stock market crash.\n\nSwift economic intervention enabled the South African economy to recover after several years of decline, but many of the work schemes were based on manual labour, and did not address the significant levels of poverty in working class society. Capital spending from the private sector all but ceased as a result.\n\nIntroducing more reorganised work programmes and industrial projects should provide; reassurance, stable employment, and a route to free the economy from these last remnants of the depression."
SAF_economic_relief_costs:0 "Legacy of the Depression"
SAF_economic_relief_costs_desc:0 "The economic stimulus and work programmes undertaken by the government to tackle the great depression eventually succeeded, but also created significant levels of debt that the treasury now has to deal with.\n\nThe interest payments are being met but there is precious little capacity in the budget for additional economic programmes.\n\nAdditional revenue sources and increased exports will significantly ease the burden and pressure on the treasury's finances."
SAF_economic_boom_times:0 "Plentiful Labor"
SAF_economic_boom_times_desc:0 "Recent growth in economic activity has brought a boost for the treasury's tax collection. Additional revenue has turned up and allowed the treasury to provide more funds to government projects as a result."
SAF_overextended_budget:0 "Over Extended Budget"
SAF_overextended_budget_desc:0 "Recent additional spending has not been properly supported by the government's annual budget, pushing the South African treasury towards a liquidity issue. A rapid solution is being fond in the bond markets, but there is a price to pay for such financial maneouvers."

SAF_south_african_commandos:0 "South African Commandos"
SAF_south_african_commandos_desc:0 "The Boer wars between the British and the Boer settlers saw the emergence home-grown commando warfare. These skills are not lost to distant memory and could be revived in new units, trained to handle the difficult jobs in hard-to-reach places and without much support.
SAF_vanguard_of_the_eighth_army:0 "Vanguard of the Eighth Army"
SAF_vanguard_of_the_eighth_army_desc:0 "Tanks have come a long way from the sluggish beasts of the last war. With our infantry losses steadily rising we should move towards adopting Armoured Divisions as our core formation. Wherever the British Eighth Army is deployed, we will position ourselves as the shock formation and the spearhead of her advances. South African armour will become her vanguard."
SAF_hawker_hartebeest_local_production:0 "Hawker Hartebeest Production Order"

SAF_boer_tensions:0 "Boer Tensions"
SAF_boer_tensions_desc:0 "While the Union of South Africa is officially a core member of the British Empire, it is also widely known as the "awkward dominion" in the British halls of power.\n\nThis is because the majority of the large Afrikaner population, the descendents of the original dutch settlers, have two wars against the British Empire in living memory and hold key positions in the government of the Union. The majority of afrikaners have no intention of fighting to defend the British Empire in any future war and will actively resist attempts by the state to coerce them into serving.\n\nThe subject is a key divider in south african society and, if mishandled, could see us plunged yet again into civil war."
SAF_hendrik_van_der_bijl:0 "Hendrik Van Der Bijl"

SAF_social_welfare_costs:0 "Economic Relief Bills"
SAF_social_welfare_costs_desc:0 "The great depression is putting unprecedented pressure on the South African Treasury. As our economy has little diversification, government revenues are being hit hard.\n\nWorryingly, this additional government debt is affecting the performance of the economy. While these effects are likely to be temporary, as the economy will almost certainly begin to recover, their effects will be sorely felt unless the government's debt is well managed"
SAF_south_african_pressure:0 "South African Diplomatic Pressure"
SAF_south_african_pressure_desc:0 "The South African Government has begun a campaign of diplomatic pressure against our government due to our current policies regarding the native population. While we ca attempt to resist its political impact, London has given official approval to the action and our economy is reliant on South Africa's. To secure our own personal political positions we should begin adopting policies more in line with British and South African policies in Africa."
SAF_south_african_industrial_support_infantry:0 "South African Industrial Production"
SAF_south_african_industrial_support_infantry_desc:0 "South Africa is the main industrial centre of the African continent and its manufacturing base is growing rapidly from scratch. The South African Government is quite eager to help equip our forces, knowing only too well that their ultimate security partly rests on our shoulders."
SAF_south_african_industrial_support_motor:0 "South African Motor Company Support"
SAF_south_african_industrial_support_motor_desc:0 "The size and scale of South Africa's pre-war automobile industry has allowed them to deploy significant numbers of trucks for their campaigns in Africa. To support our fighting formation in the field, the [SAF.GetAdjective] government has offered to provide logistical services and transport to our units."
SAF_south_african_industrial_support_air:0 "South African Aircraft Maintenance Support"

SAF_anglophone_resistance_desc:0 "Although they do not represent a majority of the white population of South Africa, British descended aettlers are an important pillar of South African industry and government.\n\nThey will undoubtedly oppose any movement away from the British Commonwealth, and will seek to maintain close ties with Britain."

The initial one million pounds that funded the launch of the company was raised by sources in the United Kingdom and the United States. In 1926, Anglo American PLC became a majority shareholder in De Beers Company, the leading diamond company in the world.\n\nSouth African interest in the african Copperbelt was led by the Anglo American Corporation, which acquired control of the Nkana mine at Kitwe and formed Rhodesian Anglo American, whose other shareholders included US and South African finance houses and the British South Africa Company (BSAC).\n\nThis mining empire also spread out into iron, nickle and coal deposits and was so successfully operated that the company became the top gold-mining company in the world in the post-war years. It is currently the fourth largest company in the world."

###   DECISIONS   ###
#####################

SAF_develop_railway_integration:0 "[FROM.GetName] Railway Integration"
SAF_develop_railway_integration_desc:0 "The local railway infrastructure within [FROM.GetName] was built to facilitate the export of minerals and livestock to markets further afield. Very little planning for the local railway infrastructure considered the other modes of transport available. If we make some modest investments to improve the connections between the railways and local buisness needs we will likely see a boost in [FROM.GetName]'s economic performance."
SAF_expand_ford_south_africa:0 "Ford South Africa Expansion Scheme"
SAF_expand_ford_south_africa_desc:0 "The Ford Motor Company of Canada established a subsidiary buisness in South Africa in the 1920s where it has mainly assembled imported car kits for the South African market. Given the importance of trucks and cars for our agricultural and mining industries we should discuss the possibility of manufacturing complete vehicles domestically with the directors of the company."
SAF_mobilise_ford_south_africa:0 "Mobilise Ford South Africa"
SAF_mobilise_ford_south_africa_desc:0 "With war upon us once again we need to mobilise every industrial resource we have. The assembly lines of Ford are legendary and we should configure their facilities and methods to produce war material."

SAF_smuts_speech_london:0 "The "Mother of all Parliaments" Speech"
SAF_smuts_speech_london_desc:0 "Prime Minister Smuts has been invited by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to address a combined session of the British House of Lords and the House of Commons within the British Parliament.\n\nSmuts is no stranger to public speaking, but he was clearly humbled by the offer and the opportunity to address, as he put it, "The mother of all parliaments".\nNevertheless he vowed to travel to Westminster and will make the case that;\n"This war is a new crusade, a new fight to the death, for man's rights and liberties.""
SAF_introduce_red_tabs:0 "Introduce the Red Tabs"
SAF_introduce_red_tabs_desc:0 "Due to current Union Defence Force regulations we can only dispatch volunteers to serve abroad alongside our commonwealth allies.\nThis restriction means that we must find favourable ways to encourage further volunteers. One proposal is for volunteers to be given a distinctive red shoulder tab that would symbolise their bravery and commitment to the defence of the Union. While a little underhand this will undoubtedly coerce additional men to volunteer."
SAF_introduce_the_africa_oath:0 "Introduce the Africa Oath"
SAF_introduce_the_africa_oath_desc:0 "Within the UDF there are many members who do not wish to participate in a fight alongside our British and commonwealth allies. Currently they are entitled to only serve within South Arica, but their reluctance could indicate a lack of loyalty to the union.\n\nTo ensure that all troops who are fighting in our divisions abroad are loyal we will mandate that an "Africa oath" be taken. Agreement to take this oath will be met with an additional stipend to soldier's monthly pay. These changes should both increase the loyalty of our forces in the field and make volunteering to serve abroad a lot more attractive."
SAF_railways_and_harbours_appropriation_act:0 "South African Railways and Harbours Appropriation Act"
SAF_railways_and_harbours_appropriation_act_desc:0 "South African Railways and Harbours (SARH) are the largest employer in the country and their workshops have the single largest manufacturing capability in South Africa. The SARH Appropriation Act will make these workshops immediately available for war production."
SAF_south_african_broadcasting_corporation:0 "South African Broadcasting Corporation Campaign"
SAF_south_african_broadcasting_corporation_desc:0 "While there has been an initial rush of volunteers with the commencement of the war, numbers have begun to taper off as the most enthusiastic have already signed up. The South African Broadcasting Corporation has agreed to run a series of patriotic programmes to encourage more volunteers."
SAF_south_african_womens_auxiliary_service:0 "South African Womens Auxiliary Service"
SAF_south_african_womens_auxiliary_service_desc:0 "It is no secret that the South African Expeditionary Force is stretched for manpower. Over two thirds of those serving in the UDF outside of south africa are of British descent and there are many roles still left vacant.\n\nOne suggestion has been for the creation of a womens auxiliary service, modeled on the existing British structure, for the army, navy and air force respectively. These patriotic women will not be allowed into the combat arms but will be able to undertake vital functions in the supporting and clerical arms of the UDF, SANF, and SAAF.\n\nThis will also free up critical manpower to fill gaps in the combat arms."

SAF_intern_the_stormjaers:0 "Intern the Stormjagers"
SAF_intern_the_stormjaers_desc:0 "The Stormjagers are the so called 'elite' of the OB. In reality they are the fanatical para-military wing of the party and contain the most militarised members of the organisation, men undoubtedly familiar with firearms.\n\nWe must act against the leadership and structure of this organisation, end its ability to undertake operations and thereby remove the main armed threat to the South African Government. The Directorate of Intelligence will lead the operation."
SAF_root_out_police_ob_supporters:0 "Root out OB Supporters in the Police"
SAF_root_out_police_ob_supporters_desc:0 "The OB has supporters and symphathisers throughout south african society. This sadly also includes within the south african police where there have been rumours of some officer being complicit in acts against the state, and suggestions that they have been passing on information.\n\nTo ensure the police's loyalty to the state we should undertake operations to screen and interview their officers so that those with OB sympathies can be sidelined."
SAF_screen_the_civil_service_for_ob_supporters:0 "Screen the Civil Service"
SAF_screen_the_civil_service_for_ob_supporters_desc:0 "The OB has supporters and symphathisers throughout south african society, which is also reflected in the civil service.\nWhile most members are loyal and impartial to the government, there are members who would seek to undermine the state's ability to act against the OB.\n\nReviewing the screening process for current and recruited civil servants should reduce the ability fo the OB to influence the machinery of government and allow us to act against them more effectively."
SAF_clamp_down_on_ob_civic_organisations:0 "Clamp Down on OB Civic Organisations"
SAF_clamp_down_on_ob_civic_organisations_desc:0 "The core of the OB is actually listed as a civic organisation under south african law and cannot be deemed a threat simply because it exists.\n\nNevertheless it is clear that the organisation is acting against the interests of the Union and actions are therefore being taken to constrain the activities and growth of the organisation's core group."

SAF_namibia_commercial_farming:0 "Encourage Commercial Farming"
SAF_namibia_commercial_farming_desc:0 "The German Empire always sought to make south-west africa a settler colony and was interested in developing commercial farming to sustain this colony situated so far away from any other German territory. With only 1 percent of the territory's land being arable, the industry didn't survive. Consolidating this land into fewer but larger entities will provide the industry with greater resilience and efficency."
SAF_maintain_the_police_zone:0 "Maintain the Police Zone"
SAF_maintain_the_police_zone_desc:0 "The German Empire imposed an administrative border within south-west africa. The so-called police zone seperated the settler communities and more settled tribes in the south of the territory from the more under developed peoples in the north. This line has been maintained to enable to tribal groups in the north to undertake their lives without disturbance from the communities in the south and vice versa. It has also proven very effective means of stopping cattle diseases from Portugese Angola from spreading further south."
SAF_south_west_africa_native_labour_association:0 "South-west Africa Native Labour Association"
SAF_south_west_africa_native_labour_association_desc:0 "The war effort is requiring ever greater numbers of men to be drafted in to serve the needs of industry. As the majority of the population is already economically active, we need to begin drafting in laour from south-west africa to make up the shortfall. While these labourers will of course receive wages, they are unlikely to be completely happy with being conscripted to serve in a mine or in agriculture."
SAF_pelican_point_quays_construction:0 "Walvis Bay Quays Construction"
SAF_pelican_point_quays_construction_desc:0 "Walvis bay has the best sited natural harbour along the entire south-west african coast. The shelter afforded in the lee of Pelican Point makes it an excellent location to construct a new quayside for shipping to dock into. These quays will provide a much more affordable means to load and export goods from the region."
SAF_ore_handling_infrastructure:0 "Walvis Bay Ore Infrastructure"
SAF_ore_handling_infrastructure_desc:0 "The export potential of south-west africa's vast mineral wealth is limited by the lack of any means to efficently load it aboard merchant shipping. Constructing dedicated ore handling infrastructure will allow trains to unload their cargo into a secure facility, that then transports it via conveyor belt onto ships. Thereby greatly reducing the operating costs of the mining companies."
SAF_reguage_the_otavibahn:0 "Re-guage the Otavibahn"
SAF_reguage_the_otavibahn_desc:0 "The original German administrators of south-west africa built a dedicated small guage railway to connect their inland mines in Tsumeb with their ramshackle port at Swakopmund. Rather annoyingly they built it as a 600mm guage line rather than the more common 610mm (3ft 6in) cape guage present across the rest of southern africa. Re-gauging this line to the cape guage will be costly but should facilitate greater regional trade."

SAF_southwest_africa_economic_integration_desc:0 "The projects we have undertaken to improve the infrastructure in south-west africa and ovamboland has led to a modest but noticeable uptake in economic activity in the region.

SAF_improve_relations_with_the_nama_people_desc:0 "The Nama peoples live predominantly in the south of the police zone and are the smalest of the major tribal groupings in south-west africa. With the arrival of settlers in their lands and the breaking up of their traditional homelands they have become dispersed and risk losing their heritage. To show our positive intentions to this land we should begin including their traditional leaders in local policy making."

SAF_improve_relations_with_the_herero_people_desc:0 "The Herero peoples suffered brutally at the hads of the former german overlords. In 1904 the Herero Genocide saw the germans kill them in their thousands and this has had a lasting impact on their attitude to the settlers and foreign administration. To build our legitimacy in south-west africa we must begin to heal these wounds and give them a stake in the future of the region."

SAF_send_delegation_to_HCT_NMB_desc:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] are one of the key african territories for the proposed Southern African Federation.

The De Beers firm and Anglo-American are the biggest names in the buisness with established connections into the Empire's and America's diamond purchasers.\n\nBy utilising the strengths of these companies and the British Diamond exchange that they operate through, we can make a significant profit from the sale of industrial diamonds, one that will prove very lucrative to our treasury."
SAF_independent_diamond_exchange_sales:0 "Independent Diamond Sales Efforts"
SAF_independent_diamond_exchange_sales_desc:0 "Without the commercial weight of the De Beers company, Anglo-American and the London Diamond Exchange on our side, sales efforts are proving far less profitable. While their practises were monopolistic and sought to constrain the market, they did at least bring in higher profits and did not require our overworked civil servants to dedicate time to negotiating sales."
SAF_organise_british_gold_contracts:0 "Organise British Gold Contracts"
SAF_organise_british_gold_contracts_desc:0 "The Amrican Cash and Carry policy has put Britain into a pickle. In order to buy American munitions and support it has to pay upfront in dollars. As the Empire is run on sterling this is obviously difficult and the US government intentionally made it difficult to undercut Britain's position as the global financial hegemon.\n\nAs Britain mobilises her economy for war, she is sacrificing the industries which allowed her to export goods to the United States and earn dollars in return.\n\nBy purchasing South African gold in major quantities, Britain has a means of paying for the american munitions with sacrificing dollars.\nBritain can pay us in sterling for the gold and then sell the gold to the americans for dollars, and then use these dollars to buy the american munitions.\n\nIt is complicated but will allow Britain to keep funding the war effort for longer. This is one of the most important ways for South Africa to contribute to the Imperial war effort."

SAF_reconstitute_the_cape_corps_desc:0 "Historically, we have been able to recruit some of our Coloured population into service to defend South Africa. This is not popular with everyone in the country, the Nationalists in particular are aghast to any notion of native armed troops, but it will free white South Africans to serve overseas and provide a disciplined force of pioneers, prison garrison troops and support personnel."

SAF_prepare_the_cape_regiments_desc:0 "The old Cape Colony region was the first dutch settled region in south africa and the site of the first Britsh settled region in South Africa. Its military heritage reflects these two influences and the people of the Cape region. Many of the ACF regiments are based in this region and should be a priority for remobilisation of the UDF."

SAF_prepare_the_natal_regiments_desc:0 "The Natal region was previously a British colony that was subsumed into the Union in 1902. Its population are predominantly of Khosa and British ancestry, although only the latter group is represented in the army due to the UDF's regulations. Several of these regiments are disproportionately staffed by Permanent Force cadres and are therefore well suited for early mobilisation."

SAF_prepare_the_transvaal_regiments_desc:0 "The Transvaal and Orange Provinces are the most populous in the Union and have the largest number of regiments based within them. While most of these regiments are in the ACF, their lineages reflect both the British and Boer influences on the region. They should be re-equiped and brought up to strength as soon as possible, to ensure they are ready to defend the integrity of the Union."

SAF_south_african_special_forces:0 "Revive Commando Warfare"
SAF_south_african_special_forces_desc:0 "The Boer wars between the British and the Boer settlers saw the emergence home-grown commando warfare.

SAF_mechanization_effort:0 "Adopt the Universal Carrier"
SAF_mechanization_effort_desc:0 "South Africa's casualties in the First World War were horrendous due to the terrible power of artillery on vulnerable infantry.

SAF_form_sa_armoured_corps:0 "Form the South African Armoured Corps"
SAF_form_sa_armoured_corps_desc:0 "The Great War showed us the necessity of providing protection for our troops in the field and the current war in the desert reinforces it. The South African aroured corps should be established from our remaining "cavalry" regiments and begin preparations for deployment. The manpower shortages that we are facing may force us to switch towards using armoured divisions, so the armour had better be ready."
SAF_armor_effort:0 "Vanguard of the Eighth Army"
SAF_armor_effort_desc:0 "Tanks have come a long way from the sluggish beasts of the last war. With our infantry losses steadily rising we should move towards adopting Armoured Divisions as our core formation.

SAF_replace_the_blenheim:0 "Develop the Training Squadrons"
SAF_replace_the_blenheim_desc:0 "The South African Airforce is still in its infancy and the five year plan calls for a gradual expansion of the organisation. Private flying clubs and Imperial exchange courses will not have sufficent capacity for this expansion so we should leap on the opportunity to develop training squadrons. These schools and their cohorts of students will form the basis of an expanding SAAF."

SAF_joint_air_training_scheme_desc:0 "The Joint Air Training Scheme (JATS) saw 38 South African–based air schools employed to train Royal Air Force, SAAF and other allied air and ground crews. Aircraft and equipment required for the training were provided to South Africa free of charge by the United Kingdom. During its five-year existence, the JATS turned out a total of 33,347 aircrew, including 12,221 SAAF personnel and utilised 1,709 military aircraft."

SAF_desert_air_force:0 "Support the Desert Air Force"
SAF_desert_air_force_desc:0 "Controlling the skies above the deserts of North Africa will be key to achieving victory there. The SAAF must specialise in operating in such an environment to ensure that we are not threatened from the North. The heat and sand necessitates special attention being directed towards maintaining our aircraft and the valuable skills which are to be learned in that unforgiving environment."
SAF_purchase_the_hurricanes:0 "Purchase the Hurricane"
SAF_purchase_the_hurricanes_desc:0 "The Hawker company's first monoplane interceptor, the Hurricane, is now entering mass production in Britain and is also starting production in Canada. While the Spitfire may have better performance qualities, desert airfields are primitive, and our aircraft need to be dependable. The ruggedness and reliability of the Hurricane makes it the preferable choice for operations over North Africa."

SAF_rule_the_skies:0 "Rule the Skies"
SAF_rule_the_skies_desc:0 "Commonwealth forces in North Africa need complete dominance of the air to ensure that their operations are not spotted by enemy scout aircraft and not scuppered by strafing aircraft.

SAF_death_from_above:0 "Death From Above"
SAF_death_from_above_desc:0 "The Germans made ferocious use of ground attack aircraft during the Battle of France, with their airforce causing far more damage to morale than their destructive capabilites ever could. Close coordination between our ground attack squadrons and Commonwealth land forces will be key to success in the sands of North Africa and the hills of Italy. Fritz will learn to fear our very presence."

SAF_sturmock_dry_dock_desc:0 "Though the waters around the Cape of Good Hope have seen steadily reduced shipping traffic, there are still large commercial vessels in need of a safe haven from the treacherous Southern Ocean.
