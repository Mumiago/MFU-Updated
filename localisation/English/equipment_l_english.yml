As a fast infantry tank, the T-28 is relatively well-protected, with quite impressive firepower, distributed among two forward auxiliary turrets, with 220° traverse, each flanking the main cylindrical turret. The main turret is based on the T-26 turret design and carries a large, low-velocity gun, the 76.2 mm KT-28 howitzer. The engine is a gargantuan air-cooled V12 boasting a 48 liter capacity, developing 500 bhp. This V12 M17 is a famous aircraft engine, notably propelling the Tupolev giant planes and nearly all Soviet bombers"

 SOV_medium_tank_equipment_1939_desc:0 "The next evolution of the T-28 is the M variant, with a L-10 76.2 mm gun of longer caliber (from 16.5 to 23). This means quite better muzzle velocity. It is served by a gun stabilization system devised by A.A. Prokofiev, which gives both some real antitank capabilities and a total 60° of elevation, which provides greater range. The turret has still a limited traverse of only 60°. A large turret basket is fitted, with a machine-gun ball mount. Propulsion is also improved by the adoption of the M17L engine."

 SOV_medium_tank_equipment_1941_desc:0 "The T-34 is an universal tank devised by Alexander Koshkin after the experiences against the Japanese to replace the insufficiently armoured and armed light tanks, and the outdated T-28. At the moment, the T-34 has no equivalent in the world. The vehicle combines almost to perfection the triangle of speed, armor and armament, in addition the design fits perfectly for mass production. The tank isn't without faults though. The visibility and ergonomics are generally poor and the christie suspension takes a lot of valuable internal space."

 SOV_heavy_tank_equipment_1939_desc:0 "The KV-1 represents a compleately new direction in Soviet breakthrough tank design. Gone are the multiple turrets of T-35, being unable to cope with the realities of modern battlefield. Instead it has armour unpiercable by any tank equipped guns of our adversaries, a modern 76mm cannon and a 600hp 12-cylinder diesel V-1 which is able to propel the vehicle through the enemy lines at an unprecedented speed for a 45 ton colossus."

Under the armour, the chassis is left virtually unchanged from the IS-2. As a result we have a heavy tank practically impervious to conventional AT weapons without having to spend time designing the tank from the ground up. Though the rushed nature of the design can be felt as less than optimal reliability."

It is much smaller and lighter than the German and U. S. howitzers of the same caliber, weighing even less than the standard 75 mm  guns used in Europe in the Great War. Despite its lightness and its appearance of not having been quite finished, it is capable of throwing a (16 kg) shell very nearly as far as can the heavier and far more formidable looking German 105 mm howitzer."

The most remarkable fact about the Type 92, aside from its appearance, is the great range that it attains with a 16 kg shell in proportion to its unusually low weight. It has been reported that the weapon is rarely fired at extreme ranges, which require the use of a supercharge, because of malfunctions in the recoil system caused thereby."

 SOV_heavy_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "From the late 1920s the RKKA sought to upgrade its World War I-era artillery pieces. One of the modernized weapons was the 152 mm howitzer M1909, initially designed by the French arms manufacturer Schneider. After a number of experiments it was determined that the muzzle velocity of the piece could be increased to about 395 m/s (further increase could result in a damage to the carriage).In 1930-1931, the Perm plant developed a modernization project. Initially, the only element of the project was lengthening the chamber to 340 mm. In late production pieces minor changes in breechblock, cradle and elevation mechanism were introduced. Some pieces also had their wooden wheels replaced by steel ones with rubber tires. The modernized weapon was officially adopted as 152-mm howitzer model 1909/30."

Compared to the former, the ML-20 has better range, which often allows it to shell positions of enemy artillery while remaining immune to enemy fire. Its advantage over the latter is in weight and cost, and therefore in mobility and production rate. This universality was achieved by wide range of elevation angles and by using separate loading with 13 different propellant loads. This gun is also mounted in two of our assault guns, the SU-152 and ISU-152."

The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit, level with the leading edge of the wing and the navigator-bombardier, who was also provided with flying controls, sat in the extensively glazed gondola beneath the pilot. The radio operator sat towards the rear of the gondola and in early aircraft operated two 7.7 mm (0.303 in) Lewis guns. Nose and dorsal turrets, each carrying a Lewis gun, completed the defensive armament, while the gondola also housed an internal bomb-bay."

Although the LeOs were typically faster than many fighters and also faster than almost all other types of bomber, the Luftwaffe was equipped with fighters that were even faster. The cruise speed, up to 420 km/h, was one of the strengths of the LeOs performance and made them difficult to intercept. The diving and climbing speeds were very good as well for the time. "

USA_mechanized_equipment_1_desc:0 "To solve the issues armoured cars were having regards to ground pressure, the White Motor Company took the Timken rear bogie assembly from a T9 half-track truck and added it to an M3 scout car, creating the T7 half-track car. This vehicle was significantly underpowered. When a further requirement came down from US Army artillery units for a prime mover to be used as an artillery tractor, a vehicle with an uprated engine was developed, which was designated the half-track scout car T14. Finally, the vehicle has been standardized as the M2 half-track car."

Originally given the experimental designation VK 1303, it was adopted under the alternate name Panzerspähwagen II and given the popular name Luchs ("Lynx"). The Luchs was larger than the Ausf. G in most dimensions (length 4.63 m; height 2.21 m; width 2.48 m). It was equipped with a six speed transmission (plus reverse), and could reach a speed of 60 km/h (37 mph) with a range of 290 km (180 mi). The FuG12 and FuG Spr a radios were installed, while 330 rounds of 20 mm and 2,250 rounds of 7.92 mm ammunition were carried. Total vehicle weight was 11.8 tonnes"

 MAN_heavy_anti_air_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Type 88 75 mm AA gun is based on an exhaustive evaluation by the Army Technical Bureau of several existing overseas designs, amalgamating some of the best features from each design, especially from the World War I-vintage British Vickers QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA gun into a new, Japanese design.  Although it has been difficult and expensive weapon for us to produce with our limited industrial infrastructure and production technology, it has been produced in large numbers."

 MAN_heavy_anti_air_equipment_2_desc:0 "Our forces have captured examples of the Bofors M29 75mm AA gun from the National Revolutionary Army of the Kuomintang government of China, and the Army Technical Bureau is impressed with its performance, which is much superior to the existing Japanese Type 88 75 mm AA Gun. By reverse engineering a close copy was designed."

 ITA_heavy_anti_air_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Cannone da 90/53 is derived from a naval 90mm AA cannon designed by Ansaldo. The gun is an advanced design with an autofretted monobloc barrel with a screwed-on breech ring containing the horizontal sliding breech block and seatings for the recoil and run-out cylinders. The AT performance is at least equal to the famous German 88."
