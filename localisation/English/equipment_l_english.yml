GER_armored_cars_equipment_1_desc:0 "The construction of the Kfz.13 consisted of a simple armored body placed on the civilian Adler Standard 6 chassis. The original curved mudguards were left unchanged. The top was left open, which enabled the crew to have an excellent view of the surroundings but left them highly vulnerable to enemy fire. As this vehicle was never intended to be used in real combat, this was not seen as an issue. The primary function of this vehicle was to provide German manufacturers with experience in designing and building armored cars."

Armour was 14 mm at the front on a sloped body, suitable to deflect most small or low-velocity projectiles. The standard armament was a MG 34 machine-gun in an open Turret. Official designation was Leichter Panzerspähwagen Sdkfz.221 (Light Reconnaissance Armored Car -Special Purpose Vehicle 221). 340 were delivered from 1936 to 1939. This four-wheeled vehicle proved to be fast ( 80 km/h ) and agile, but it quickly became apparent it had limited off-road capabilities. In some cases, the original MG was swapped for an anti-tank rifle 39 or, later, a model 41 28 mm anti-tank gun, in order to increase its firepower. The armor was suitable against small arms fire and shrapnel. It was crewed by 2 men."

It managed a road top speed of 80 km/h. and had the same limitations crosscountry as the 221.

The original 6 Rad (6 wheel) versions were based on a 6x4 truck with an armoured body, but its offroad mobility was insufficient and by 1937 they were being replaced by the 8 Rad versions. The Sdkfz.231 had 15 mm of slightly sloped front armour. Production versions of the SdKfz.231 were fitted with a 155 HP, eight-cylinder Büssing-NAG L8V-G petrol engine, which gave a top speed of 85 km/h. From July 1942 they were built on the same Einheitsfahrgestell chassis and had their armour increased to 30 mm. Later a more powerful engine was installed, providing 180 PS instead of 155 PS. It had all-wheel-drive, all-wheel-steering and two driver positions at front and rear. The turret in the 231/232 series was a hexagonal shape and equipped with a 2 cm KwK 30 L/55 autocannon and a coaxial 7.92 mm MG 34 machine gun."

The Martin AM Mauler was an ansver the these requirements.  In service, the Mauler earned the nickname "Able Mable" because of its remarkable load-carrying ability, once lifting 4,830 kg of ordnance, perhaps the heaviest load ever carried by a single-engine, piston-powered aircraft. But the plane was also heavy handling, which caused it to be difficult to fly in formation, and hard to land aboard a carrier."

USA_CAS_equipment_1941_desc:0 "The SBD was the United States Navy's main carrier-based scout/dive bomber from mid-1940 through mid-1944. The SBD was also flown by the United States Marine Corps, both from land air bases and aircraft carriers. The SBD is best remembered as the bomber that delivered the fatal blows to the Japanese carriers at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The type earned its nickname "Slow But Deadly" (from its SBD initials) during this period."

After entering service with the United States Army aviation units, the aircraft quickly received the reputation of a "widowmaker" due to the early models' high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. This was because the Marauder had to be flown at precise airspeeds.The B-26 became a safer aircraft once crews were re-trained, and after aerodynamics modifications. The Marauder ended World War II with the lowest loss rate of any USAAF bomber."

The wing gave the Liberator a high cruise speed, long range and the ability to carry a heavy bomb load. In comparison with its contemporaries, the B-24 was relatively difficult to fly and had poor low-speed performance; it also had a lower ceiling and was less robust than the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. While aircrews tended to prefer the B-17, General Staff favored the B-24 and procured it in huge numbers for a wide variety of roles. At approximately 18,500 units it holds records as the world's most produced bomber, heavy bomber, multi-engine aircraft, and American military aircraft in history."

FRA_armored_cars_equipment_3_desc:0 "A reconnaissance vehicle to replace all the earlier types. In order to function as an effective long-range reconnaissance vehicle, the Panhard 178 had been kept as light as possible. The vehicle was thus rather small. THE design was very advanced for its day and still appeared modern in the 1970s. It had a crew of four and was equipped with an effective 25 mm main armament and a 7.5 mm coaxial machine gun"

FRA_armored_cars_equipment_4_desc:0 "A 178 with a new turret FL1. It had a cylindrical "camembert" form allowing for more space to install the larger 75 mm SA 45 L/32 gun. Before actual manufacture started however, it was decided to fit the smaller 47 mm SA35 gun and a machine gun."

FRA_armored_cars_equipment_5_desc:0 "The Panhard AM 40 P was a groundbreaking armoured car for its time. The prototype had a low profile which made it harder to detect and was perfect for reconnaissance missions. It was manned by a crew of two. It has an uncommon 8x8 wheel configuration. The unusual turret pioneered the oscillating turret concept. The main armament of the Panhard AM 40 P was the 25mm SA 35 gun. It was placed in the right side of the turret to make space for the commander in the small turret. Secondary armament was a 7.5mm Reibel machine gun. "

USA_mechanized_equipment_1_desc:0 "To solve the issues armoured cars were having regards to ground pressure, the White Motor Company took the Timken rear bogie assembly from a T9 half-track truck and added it to an M3 scout car, creating the T7 half-track car. This vehicle was significantly underpowered. When a further requirement came down from US Army artillery units for a prime mover to be used as an artillery tractor, a vehicle with an uprated engine was developed, which was designated the half-track scout car T14. Finally, the vehicle has been standardized as the M2 half-track car."

GER_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed in the late 1920s, this gun represents a major advance on its predecessor the 10.5 cm leFH 16. It is superior in caliber to its contemporaries, with adequate range and firepower, but the modern split trail gun carriage which provides it with more stability and traverse also renderes it overly heavy for a mobile role in the largely horse-drawn artillery battalions of the Heer."

The new single-motion "Asbury breech" allowed for higher rates of fire with a Welin tapered screw. With these improvements the 18-pounder from Mk IV onwards was in effect a new weapon but as the calibre and ammunition remained the same it was referred to as part of the 18 pdr development cycle. The Mk V carriage with split trail entered service in 1923, it allowed 25 degrees left and right traverse without moving the trail and up to 37.5 degrees elevation."

The 75 gave its best performances during the Battle of the Marne in August–September 1914 and at Verdun in 1916. In the case of Verdun, over 1,000 French 75s (250 batteries) were constantly in action, night and day, on the battlefield during a period of nearly nine months."

Compared to the former, the ML-20 has better range, which often allows it to shell positions of enemy artillery while remaining immune to enemy fire. Its advantage over the latter is in weight and cost, and therefore in mobility and production rate. This universality was achieved by wide range of elevation angles and by using separate loading with 13 different propellant loads. This gun is also mounted in two of our assault guns, the SU-152 and ISU-152."

 ENG_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 ENG_ship_hull_heavy_3:0 "Lion Class"

Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."

 ENG_ship_hull_heavy_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."

 ENG_ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 ENG_SH_ship_hull_heavy_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 ENG_SH_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 ENG_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb:0 "Courageous Class "
 ENG_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 ENG_ship_hull_carrier_1:0 "Ark Royal Class "
 ENG_ship_hull_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 ENG_ship_hull_carrier_2:0 "Illustrious Class"
 ENG_ship_hull_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 ENG_ship_hull_carrier_3:0 "Implacable Class"
 ENG_ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

Authorized in the 1931 and 1934 naval programs, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armor and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 FRA_ship_hull_heavy_1:0 "Courbet Class "
 FRA_ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorized in the 1910 and 1911 naval programs, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armor and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernizations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."

 FRA_ship_hull_heavy_2:0 "Richelieu Class "
 FRA_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorized under the 1935 and 1938 naval programs. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 FRA_ship_hull_heavy_3:0 "Gascogne Class"
 FRA_ship_hull_heavy_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval program but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 FRA_ship_hull_heavy_4:0 "Alsace Class"
 FRA_ship_hull_heavy_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorized in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening.

 FRA_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armor belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 FRA_ship_hull_carrier_1:0 "Joffre Class "
 FRA_ship_hull_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorized in the 1938 naval program, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armor, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 FRA_ship_hull_carrier_2:0 "Jean Bart Class"
 FRA_ship_hull_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defense against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 FRA_ship_hull_carrier_3:0 "Clemenceau Class"
 FRA_ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Clemenceau class aircraft carrier (Project name PA-28) were the first postwar carrier design of the French Navy. The design would be similar to the unfinished Joffre class carriers, though the installed equipment and weaponry would be of modern French products. The acquisition of the USN and RN escort carriers and the economical state of postwar France prevented these ships from being laid down. Not to be confused with the latter Clemenceau class aircraft carriers (Project name PA-54), which were laid down in 1955 and 1957."

The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 SOV_ship_hull_heavy_1:0 "Marat Class "
 SOV_ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."

 SOV_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb:0 "Ismail Class"
 SOV_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 SOV_ship_hull_carrier_1:0 "Krasnyi Vozdukh"
 SOV_ship_hull_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 SOV_ship_hull_carrier_2:0 "Project 71B"
 SOV_ship_hull_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 SOV_ship_hull_carrier_3:0 "Project 72"
 SOV_ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships.

 USA_ship_hull_cruiser_4:0 "Oregon City Class"
 USA_ship_hull_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Oregon City Class cruisers provided broad and marginal improvements over the Baltimore Class. Most notably was the change in the super structure which allowed better fields of AA fire. Similar improvements were also found from the Cleveland to the Oregon City class light cruisers."
 USA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Lexington Class"
 USA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Lexington Class was initially a reaction to Japan's Kongo class battlecruiser. Ordered by the Naval Act of 1916, the ships were intended to carry 16" guns in dual turrets and be capable of 33 knots. After construction began, the US entered into the Washington Naval Treaty and the USS Lexington and USS Saratoga was converted to Carriers."
 USA_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Alaska Class"
 USA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Alaska Class was a response to the German pocket battleships now more so to Japan's "super cruisers." Designed to carry 12" guns and handle up to 10" shell fire, the class was capable of cruiser speeds but sacrificed under water protection."
 USA_ship_hull_heavy_1:0 "New York Class "
 USA_ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:0 "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14"/45 caliber main guns. Numerous 5"/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armor."

 USA_ship_hull_heavy_2:0 "North Carolina Class"
 USA_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16"/45 caliber guns and have improved armor while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."
 #USA_ship_hull_heavy_2b: "South Dakota Class"
 USA_ship_hull_heavy_3:0 "Iowa Class "
 USA_ship_hull_heavy_3_desc:0 "The Iowa Class added all the innovations and capabilities of the earlier North Carolina, but substantially increases its displacement and tactical speed. The Iowa's was primarily responsible for escorting carriers groups and was designed with a second role of "cruiser killer" in mind."
 USA_ship_hull_heavy_4:0 "Illinois Class"
 USA_ship_hull_heavy_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armor. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 caliber guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximize AA capabilities."
 USA_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb:0 "Lexington Class "
 USA_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb_desc:0 "The Lexington Class carrier was born from the converted hulls of two Lexington Class battlecruisers in order to conform to the limitations imposed by the Washington Naval Treaty. The class was the first operational carrier class in the US Navy and spent several years improving carrier operations."
 USA_ship_hull_carrier_1:0 "Ranger Class "
 USA_ship_hull_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up. As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained the same air group compliment thanks to improvements on interior designs."

 USA_ship_hull_carrier_2:0 "Essex Class"
 USA_ship_hull_carrier_2_desc:1 "With the lessons learned from the preceding Lexington, Ranger and Yorktown variant classes, the result was the Essex Class, a fast ship able to carry a large complement of planes into battle. Damage control designs would also be carried over from the Yorktown class and a deck edge elevator was included to improve plane handling."
 USA_ship_hull_carrier_3:0 "Midway Class"
 USA_ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armored deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle)."
 USA_ship_hull_super_heavy_1:0 "Virginia Class"
 USA_ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernize the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 caliber guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."

 AST_ship_hull_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 AST_ship_hull_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 AST_ship_hull_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 AST_ship_hull_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 AST_ship_hull_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 AST_ship_hull_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."

 AST_ship_hull_light_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes, which were transferred to the RAN to form the 'Scrap Iron Flotilla'. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."

 AST_ship_hull_light_3_desc:0 "The Nizam class was the designation of the J, K, and N class destroyers transferred from the RN. They were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 AST_ship_hull_light_4:0 "Battle Class"
 AST_ship_hull_light_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs.

They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."

These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 AST_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 AST_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 AST_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941.

They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 #AST_ship_hull_cruiser_1b: "Canberra Class"
 AST_ship_hull_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 AST_ship_hull_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 AST_ship_hull_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 AST_ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."

These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 AST_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 AST_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 AST_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 AST_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy with quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 AST_ship_hull_heavy_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 AST_ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 AST_ship_hull_heavy_2:0 "King George V Class"
 AST_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 AST_ship_hull_heavy_3:0 "Lion Class"
 AST_ship_hull_heavy_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 AST_ship_hull_heavy_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 AST_ship_hull_heavy_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 AST_ship_hull_super_heavy_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 AST_ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 AST_SH_ship_hull_heavy_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 AST_SH_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 AST_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb:0 "Courageous Class"
 AST_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 AST_ship_hull_carrier_1:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 AST_ship_hull_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 AST_ship_hull_carrier_2:0 "Illustrious Class"
 AST_ship_hull_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 AST_ship_hull_carrier_3:0 "Implacable Class"
 AST_ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 RAJ_ship_hull_heavy_3:0 "Lion Class"
 RAJ_ship_hull_heavy_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Program to replace the aging Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 RAJ_ship_hull_heavy_4:0 "Vanguard Class"
 RAJ_ship_hull_heavy_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theater. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Program, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 RAJ_ship_hull_super_heavy_1:0 "Centurion Class"
 RAJ_ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 RAJ_SH_ship_hull_heavy_2:0 "Lion II Class"
 RAJ_SH_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 RAJ_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb:0 "Courageous Class"
 RAJ_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 RAJ_ship_hull_carrier_1:0 "Ark Royal Class"
 RAJ_ship_hull_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 RAJ_ship_hull_carrier_2:0 "Illustrious Class"
 RAJ_ship_hull_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range. "
 RAJ_ship_hull_carrier_3:0 "Implacable Class"
 RAJ_ship_hull_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."

 ROM_ship_hull_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Delfinul was a Romanian submarine built in Italy for the Romanian Navy. It was launched in 1930 and the ship displaced 650 tons and was armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes."
 ROM_ship_hull_submarine_3:0 "Requinul Class"
 ROM_ship_hull_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Requinul and Marsuinul submarines were built by the Germans for their Romanian allies. They were commissioned in 1943. The ships were based on the German Type VII submarines. The ships were medium-sized submarines, displacing 600 tons, and were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes."
 ROM_ship_hull_light_1:0 "Marasti Class"
 ROM_ship_hull_light_1_desc:0 "The Marasti class was a class of destroyers built for Romania during World War I. The four ships of the class were requisitioned by the Italian Navy during the war, and two were eventually sold to Romania in the early 1920s. They were larger destroyers, displacing over 1,400 tons. They were armed with four 120mm/45 Schneider-Canet-Armstrong guns and four 450mm torpedo tubes. They had average speed and reliability for their vintage."

 SAF_ship_hull_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Program as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 SAF_ship_hull_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_submarine_2_desc:0 "The T-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflict, as 25 percent of the constructed boats were lost during the war."
 SAF_ship_hull_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programs. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 SAF_ship_hull_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 SAF_ship_hull_light_1:0 "V/W Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_light_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Program. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 SAF_ship_hull_light_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_light_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes was the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 SAF_ship_hull_light_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_light_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 SAF_ship_hull_light_4:0 "Battle Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_light_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 SAF_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 SAF_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of twenty-eight light cruisers of the Royal Navy. They were built before and during the First World War for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions. Only the Caledon, Ceres, and Carlisle subclasses were in service by the mid 1930's."
 SAF_light_cruiser_2:0 "Southampton Class"
 SAF_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 SAF_light_cruiser_3:0 "Crown Colony Class"
 SAF_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 SAF_light_cruiser_4:0 "Minotaur Class"
 SAF_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 SAF_ship_hull_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 SAF_ship_hull_cruiser_2:0 "Surrey Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Program. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 SAF_ship_hull_cruiser_3:0 "Admiral Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 SAF_ship_hull_cruiser_4:0 "Churchill Design"
 SAF_ship_hull_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 SAF_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Renown Class"
 SAF_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 SAF_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Princess Royal Class"
 SAF_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 SAF_ship_hull_heavy_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 SAF_ship_hull_heavy_2:0 "King George V Class"
 SAF_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection.
