# Rebalanced. Instead of further strengthening ITA Troops I rather decreased the equipment-%age of Ethiopian troops which were according to reports very badly underequipped eg.partly with spears instead of firearms. Before, ingame, they were better equipped than e.g. polish troops and actually crushed the italian troops in the south ( the AI never had this problem because it shuffled majority of army to Abyssinia, supply and attrition be damned )
