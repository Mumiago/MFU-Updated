rn the game has roughly 15 offensive and 10 defensive tactics in the standard phase.

per doctrine, i guess the goal would be at least 2-3 unique tactics, and obs a good amount of standard ones
or just revamp the current ones lel

tactics based on a tier system? aka attack is tier 1, while breakthrough is tier 4?

rn we have:

Attack:(no changes)
{
	nothing to really say, its the basic 101.
	+5%
}
Assault: (changes)

Encirclement: (changes)

Shock: (changes)

Breakthrough: (changes)

Blitz: (changes)

Seize Bridge: (changes)

Mass Charge: (changes)

Banzai Charge: (changes)

Infiltration Assault: (changes)
{
	this was a ww1 tactic, and isn't very ww2 minded, so will nerf it,
	and make it a generic tactic that requires planning, obs nerfing stats.
	will prob counter all early defensive tactics or at least ambush.
	modern day elastic defence counters this however. 
}

Well Planned Attack: (changes)
{
	make this unique to infiltration branch, basically replacing infiltration assault.
	will prob retain the planning requirement, but be stronger than infiltration assault 
	and contain the same counterings, without the weakness of elastic defence counter. 
}

Relentless Assault: (changes)

Unexpected Thrust: (changes)

Supressive Barrage: (changes)
